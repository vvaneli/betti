Betti - Safe Betting

The Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental disorders included gambling disorder as a diagnosable disorder. (https://psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm)

OpenBet customers operate a safe gambling approach by offering their customers a way out of problem gambling.

They do so by using a set of safer gambling tools such as self-exclusion, play breaks, spending control, account closure, and re-opening rules, etc.



Before the internet, self-help programs were distributed as books, audio, and video series. All these can be easily adapted for websites and enhanced with media, user interactions, and quizzes. Using existing triggers, we propose integrating a therapeutic intervention program such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to identify negative thoughts and feelings and help users to challenge these and work through exercises to explore them further.



Such a program would be delivered using an automated bot programmed to learn a gambler's habit and check progress throughout their lifetime. This will limit the isolation felt during account cool-off periods, access will be limited to a mindful bot providing guidance throughout this exclusion period.
